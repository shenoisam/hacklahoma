# C Bear Necessities

C Bear Necessities is a website that interactively visualizes customer data using Google Maps API and charts. Users can visualize the data to the *bear necessities* so that they can choose what they want to see. For this specific project, we used the health-insurance related dataset provided by [Vitech](https://v3v10.vitechinc.com/hacklahoma/index.html), although the framework can be applied to any dataset.

This website was made for [Hacklahoma 2018](https://www.hacklahoma.org/), and you can see our submission page on [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/cbearnecessities). This was our first time dealing with databases and much of this tech stack, so it was a wonderful learning experience for us all.
